# Justice for Bill DiMaria-Rico

[Bill DiMaria-Rico](https://twitter.com/bouncingship), a Canadian citizen, was denied the healthcare he rightfully deserves by his own government. In a country that prides itself on its healthcare system, this is a grave injustice.

## The Plight of Bill

Bill's situation paints a grim picture of the current state of healthcare and priorities in Canada. As the nation once prided itself on its world-class healthcare system, it's disheartening to see individuals like Bill left in the lurch. The government's incessant boasting about Canada's unparalleled healthcare seems hollow when juxtaposed against the reality many citizens face. It's a sad commentary on our times when there's a palpable sense that someone like [@eth_ben](https://twitter.com/eth_ben), an outsider to the system, might be more inclined to extend a helping hand to Bill than the very institutions designed to protect and care for him. This not only underscores the urgent need for systemic reform but also calls into question the government's true priorities and commitments.

## The Harsh Reality

Several Canadians, in a display of misplaced priorities and lack of empathy, have told Bill to "pipe down" with their reasoning being that *"immigrants come first"*. This sentiment is not only disturbing but also showcases the growing divide and lack of compassion in the Canadian society.

## Quotes from rude Canadians about Bill

*"Maybe if Bill was an immigrant, he'd get the care he's crying about."*

*"Bill needs to understand that we have bigger priorities right now, like taking care of newcomers."*

*"Why is Bill complaining? He should be grateful he's even in Canada."*

*"If Bill doesn't like it here, maybe he should leave. We have enough to deal with without his whining."*

*"Bill's just another entitled Canadian. He should see how immigrants have it before complaining."*

*"Our healthcare system is stretched thin. Maybe if Bill was a refugee, he'd get faster care."*

*"Bill's just looking for attention. Our government is doing its best. Immigrants come first!"*

*"If Bill really needed care, he'd get it. He's just not a priority right now."*

*"Canada's changing, and Bill needs to get with the times. We can't cater to everyone."*

*"Bill's just another Canadian who doesn't understand the bigger picture. We have to prioritize immigrants."*

## Canada's Decline

Canada, once known for its welcoming nature and robust healthcare, seems to be turning into a place where its own citizens are left behind. The situation Bill finds himself in is a stark reminder of this decline. Canada truly has become a hell hole.
